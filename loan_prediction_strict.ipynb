    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This project's goal is to predict whether an applicant is approved for a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "To acomplish our goal we used the dataset for Loan Approval Prediction from Kaggle. It contains about 32600 entries, each with 12 attributes, but only 8 of those are numeric-valued. The not numeric ones are as follows:\n",
    "- person_age:\n",
    "    - Age of the loan applicant in years. \n",
    "    - If the applicant's age is of one extreme or the other, being too old or too young, his loan will most likely have higher chances of being refused.\n",
    "- person_income:\n",
    "    - Annual income of the applicant in currency units. \n",
    "    - A higher income strongly correlates to a loan being approved, as the applicant with have higher repayment capability and capacity.\n",
    "- person_home_ownership:\n",
    "    - Housing status of applicant, categorized with four different options, those being MORTGAGE, RENT, OWN and OTHER. \n",
    "    - Home ownership can directly correlate to the financial stability of the applicant while also providing potential collateral, thus facilitating a loan's approval.\n",
    "- person_emp_length:\n",
    "    - Number of years the applicant has been employed at their current job. \n",
    "    - As with housing status, their employment length can correspond to the applicant's income and financial stability, as the longer it is the more stable their financial status is more likely to be.\n",
    "- loan_intent:\n",
    "    - The stated purpose for the loan, categorized with six different options, those being VENTURE, EDUCATION, DEBTCONSOLIDATION, HOMEIMPROVEMENT, MEDICAL and PERSONAL. \n",
    "    - Loan purpose affects risk assessment, as for example education or home improvement motives will likely carry out to a higher earning capacity or asset value, while others like venture or personal are riskier and more prone failure in repaying.\n",
    "- loan_grade: \n",
    "    - The credit quality grade assigned to the loan, ranging from A to G, best to worst.\n",
    "    - Loan grade is used as approval likelihood, representing the lender's internal credit risk assessment. The higher the grade, the lower interest rates and higher approval rates one gets, and vice versa.\n",
    "- loan_amnt:\n",
    "    - The requested loan amount.\n",
    "    - Larger loan amounts obviously represent higher absolute risk for lenders. As a norm, the higher the loan amount the lower the approval threshold, requiring stronger compensating factors like higher income and better credit history.\n",
    "- loan_int_rate:\n",
    "    - The annual interest rate charged on the loan.\n",
    "    - Interest rates reflect risk assessment, as higher rates likely indicate higher perceived risk.\n",
    "- loan_status:\n",
    "    - The target variable, 1 being approved and 0 not approved.\n",
    "    - This is the outcome variable the model will predict.\n",
    "- loan_percent_income:\n",
    "    - The percentage of applicant's income represented by the loan payment.\n",
    "    - This is a critical debt-to-income component, as higher percentages represent greater financial strains. Values of 50% and above face significantly higher rejection.\n",
    "- cb_person_default_on_file: \n",
    "    - Credit bureau record of whether the person has defaulted before, 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no.\n",
    "    - If an applicant has previous defaults, it will dramatically reduce approval chances, as they are strong negative indicators of repayment capability.\n",
    "- cb_person_cred_hist_length:\n",
    "    - Length of the person's credit history in years.\n",
    "    - Longer credit histories allow better risk assessment and generally improve approval chances.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### The solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we used a supervised learning model trained on Kaggle’s dataset. The model’s performance was measured using the accuracy metric, which represents the percentage of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions. In other words, it shows how often the model correctly classified whether a loan was paid or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our problem—loan approval prediction—**false positives** are particularly critical. A false positive occurs when the model predicts that a loan should be approved, but in reality, it should not be. For a bank, this means granting credit to someone who is likely to default, resulting in financial loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, minimizing false positives is a top priority. From a business perspective, it is better to incorrectly deny a loan to a qualified applicant (false negative) than to approve one for an unqualified applicant. This makes **precision** an especially important metric in our analysis, as it directly measures the proportion of truly qualified applicants among those predicted as approved.\n"

    "It is important to highlight that this dataset is **synthetically generated**, not collected from actual loan applicants or real banking records. While it replicates the structure and characteristics of real-world data, it lacks the depth and complexity typically found in genuine financial behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at some of the statistics:\n",
    "- The **`person_age`** feature ranges from 20 to 123 years, with a mean of 27.6. The maximum age is unrealistically high, suggesting no filtering for outliers or data plausibility.\n",
    "- The **`person_income`** field ranges from \\$4,200 to \\$1.9 million, with a mean of about \\$64,000. This massive spread, including extremely high incomes, suggests synthetic randomness rather than actual economic distribution.\n",
    "- Features like **`loan_amnt`** and **`loan_int_rate`** also show wide variation (from \\$500 to \\$35,000, and interest rates from 5.42% to 23.22%), without clear ties to applicant risk or profile.\n",
    "- Notably, **`loan_status`** has a skewed distribution, with only ~14.2% of the entries marked as approved (`1`), which may not reflect actual institutional approval rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this data was not derived from real individuals, **we must avoid drawing concrete business conclusions** from model outputs, especially regarding variable importance or decision thresholds. For instance, while a model might learn patterns from this dataset, it does not mean those patterns would generalize to real loan applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "In real-world credit scoring systems, datasets often include or derive **informative financial ratios and risk indicators** that help institutions better assess an applicant’s ability and willingness to repay. Unlike synthetic datasets where values may be randomly assigned or loosely structured, actual credit data often contains engineered features that capture behavioral and financial dynamics over time.\n",

    "- **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**:\n",
    "  - Calculated as total monthly debt payments divided by gross monthly income.\n",
    "  - A key indicator of financial burden and a strong predictor of loan repayment capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disposable Income After Loan Payment**:\n",
    "  - Monthly income minus expected loan payment.\n",
    "  - Reflects financial room left after obligations.\n",

    "In our synthetic dataset, such domain-specific features are not available or derivable with confidence due to lack of granularity and real financial behavior.

    "\n",
    "🔹 person_income: \n",
    "Applicants with higher incomes are more likely to be approved because they demonstrate a stronger ability to repay the loan without financial strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 person_home_ownership: \n",
    "Owning a home can increase approval chances, as it indicates financial stability and may provide collateral, reducing the lender's risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 person_emp_length: \n",
    "Longer employment history is typically viewed positively, as it suggests job stability and a consistent income source, which are important for loan repayment.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_intent: \n",
    "The purpose of the loan can influence approval, as lenders may consider some intents (like medical or personal expenses) riskier than others (like home improvement or education).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_grade: \n",
    "Loan grade reflects the applicant’s creditworthiness; lower grades are associated with higher risk and therefore a greater likelihood of rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_amnt: \n",
    "Larger loan amounts may reduce the chances of approval, since they represent a greater financial risk for the lender if the borrower defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_int_rate: \n",
    "Higher interest rates may increase the likelihood of loan approval, as lenders are more willing to take on higher-risk borrowers if they are compensated with greater returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_percent_income: \n",
    "Higher loan-to-income ratios are associated with higher approval rates, possibly indicating that lenders are more flexible when the borrower is willing to commit a larger portion of their income to repayment.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 cb_person_default_on_file: \n",
    "Applicants with a history of default are much less likely to be approved, as past defaults are strong indicators of future risk and potential non-payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 cb_person_cred_hist_length: \n",
    "A longer credit history gives lenders more information to evaluate credit behavior, which can increase the chances of approval due to a more established financial track record."

    "### O que é uma Decision Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "Uma **árvore de decisão** é um modelo de classificação que divide os dados em subconjuntos com base em perguntas sequenciais (condições lógicas) sobre os atributos de entrada. Cada ramo representa uma decisão com base num atributo, e cada folha representa um resultado (classe).\n",
    "\n",
    "A estrutura da árvore de decisão funciona de forma semelhante a um fluxograma, onde cada nó interno representa um \"teste\" num atributo específico (por exemplo, \"idade > 30?\"), cada ramo representa o resultado desse teste, e cada nó folha representa uma classe ou decisão final. O processo começa na raiz da árvore e segue o caminho determinado pelos valores dos atributos até chegar a uma folha, que fornece a previsão.\n",
    "\n",
    "O algoritmo constrói a árvore identificando quais atributos dividem melhor os dados em grupos homogêneos, maximizando a pureza das classes em cada nó. Esta divisão recursiva continua até que critérios finais sejam atingidos, como profundidade máxima ou número mínimo de amostras por nó.\n",
    "\n",
    "No contexto de aprovação de empréstimos, a árvore pode começar por perguntar se a pessoa que pede o empréstimo tem uma renda acima de determinado valor, depois verificar a taxa de juros do empréstimo, e assim por diante, até chegar a uma decisão final de aprovar ou rejeitar.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Porquê usar Decision Trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fácil de interpretar e visualizar:** As regras de decisão são explícitas e podem ser facilmente comunicadas a stakeholders não técnicos, tornando o modelo transparente e compreensível - característica crucial em aplicações financeiras regulamentadas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Suporta atributos categóricos e numéricos:** Não é necessário transformar variáveis categóricas (como tipo de empréstimo ou estado civil) em numéricas, simplificando o pré-processamento dos dados e preservando a interpretabilidade.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Requer pouca preparação dos dados:** Ao contrário de outros algoritmos, não necessita de normalização/padronização de features e é robusto a outliers, reduzindo significativamente o tempo de preparação dos dados.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Funciona bem mesmo com relações não lineares:** Captura naturalmente interações complexas entre variáveis, como \"aprovar se renda > X e idade > Y, mas apenas se tempo de emprego > Z\", sem necessidade de transformações ou termos de interação.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computacionalmente eficiente:** Tanto no treinamento quanto na inferência. Permite decisões em tempo real em sistemas como este.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Oferece insights de importância de variáveis:** Identifica automaticamente quais fatores são mais relevantes para a decisão, fornecendo conhecimento valioso sobre o processo de aprovação.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuning com Grid Search: Parâmetros Explicados\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `criterion`\n",
    "- **Função de avaliação para as divisões**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'gini'`: Mede a impureza Gini, calculada como Σp(1-p) para todas as classes, onde p é a probabilidade de cada classe no nó. Valores mais baixos indicam maior pureza. O índice Gini tende a isolar a classe mais frequente no seu próprio ramo, o que pode ser vantajoso quando existe uma classe predominante.\n",
    "- `'entropy'`: Mede a entropia (informação), calculada como -Σp*log(p) para todas as classes. A entropia quantifica a \"surpresa\" ou incerteza na distribuição de classes. Valores mais baixos também indicam maior pureza. Comparada ao Gini, a entropia é computacionalmente mais intensiva, mas pode produzir árvores mais equilibradas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impacto:** Define como o modelo escolhe as melhores divisões em cada nó. A escolha entre Gini e entropia raramente produz árvores muito diferentes, mas entropia pode ser preferível quando todas as classes têm importância semelhante, como no caso de aprovação de empréstimos onde tanto falsos positivos quanto falsos negativos têm consequências significativas.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `max_depth`\n",
    "- **Profundidade máxima da árvore**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `None`: Sem limite de profundidade, a árvore crescerá até que todas as folhas sejam puras ou contenham menos amostras que min_samples_split. Esta opção permite que o modelo capture até mesmo relações extremamente complexas, porém frequentemente leva a overfitting, especialmente em datasets com ruído.\n",
    "- Valores como `3`, `5`, `10`: Limitam a complexidade da árvore ao número especificado de níveis de decisão. Valores baixos (3-5) produzem modelos mais simples e generalizáveis, mas podem perder padrões importantes. Valores intermediários (7-10) tentam equilibrar complexidade e generalização. Valores altos (>15) correm risco de overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impacto:** Controla o overfitting/underfitting, sendo um dos parâmetros mais importantes para regularização da árvore. Árvores muito profundas tendem a \"memorizar\" os dados de treinamento em vez de aprender padrões generalizáveis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `min_samples_split`\n",
    "- **Número mínimo de amostras necessário para dividir um nó**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ex: `2`, `5`, `10`: Valores menores (2-5) permitem divisões com poucas amostras, criando árvores mais específicas, mas podem levam a overfitting. Valores maiores (10-20) exigem mais evidências antes de criar uma nova divisão, produzindo árvores mais robustas e generalizáveis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impacto:** Evita divisões sobre pequenas amostras (overfitting). Este parâmetro funciona como uma regularização baseada em frequência, impedindo que o modelo crie regras muito específicas baseadas em poucos exemplos. No contexto de aprovação de empréstimos, isso previne que decisões sejam baseadas em padrões raros ou potencialmente falsos nos dados históricos.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Considerações adicionais:** Em datasets desiquilibrados, este valor deve ser ajustado considerando a frequência da classe minoritária. Por exemplo, se a classe de aprovados representar apenas 10% dos dados, um valor muito alto poderia impedir divisões importantes para identificar corretamente essa classe.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `min_samples_leaf`\n",
    "- **Número mínimo de amostras por folha**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ex: `1`, `2`, `4`: Define o número mínimo de amostras necessário em cada nó folha (decisão final). Valor 1 permite folhas com uma única amostra, possivelmente levando a decisões super-específicas e overfitting. Valores 2-4 exigem múltiplas amostras por decisão, garantindo maior representatividade e estabilidade.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impacto:** Evita folhas com muito poucas amostras. Semelhante ao min_samples_split, mas focado especificamente nos nós terminais (folhas). Este parâmetro é importante para garantir que cada decisão final seja baseada em um número razoável de exemplos, aumentando a confiabilidade estatística do modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relação com outros parâmetros:** Geralmente, min_samples_leaf deveria ser menor que min_samples_split.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `max_features`\n",
    "- **Número máximo de atributos considerados em cada divisão**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `None`: Usa todos os atributos disponíveis em cada decisão de divisão. Esta opção permite que o modelo considere todas as variáveis possíveis para cada decisão, possivelmente encontrando a divisão ótima global. É apropriada quando o número de features não é excessivamente grande.\n",
    "- `'sqrt'`: Raiz quadrada do total de atributos. Se tivermos 16 features, apenas 4 seriam consideradas em cada divisão. Esta restrição introduz aleatoriedade e diversidade nas divisões, reduzindo a correlação entre diferentes partes da árvore.\n",
    "- `'log2'`: Logaritmo de base 2 do total de atributos. Ainda mais restritivo que 'sqrt', levando a maior aleatoriedade nas divisões.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impacto:** Introduz aleatoriedade (útil em florestas aleatórias). Este parâmetro está relacionado ao conceito de \"feature bagging\" e é especialmente útil em Random Forests, onde queremos diversidade entre as árvores.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `min_impurity_decrease`\n",
    "- **Valor mínimo de redução de impureza para permitir uma divisão**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ex: `0.0`, `0.1`, `0.2`: Define o ganho mínimo de informação necessário para justificar uma divisão. Com 0.0, qualquer melhoria, não importa quão pequena, justifica uma nova divisão. Valores maiores (0.1-0.3) exigem melhorias significativas para criar novas divisões, resultando em árvores mais simples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impacto:** Ignora divisões que não melhoraram suficientemente o modelo. Este parâmetro funciona como um mecanismo de \"poda preventiva\", eliminando divisões de baixo valor informativo antes que ocorram.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Considerações práticas:** Em problemas de aprovação de empréstimos, onde pequenas melhorias na precisão podem significar ganhos financeiros substanciais, faz sentido permitir divisões mesmo com ganhos informacionais modestos, desde que outros parâmetros (como max_depth) estejam a controlar adequadamente a complexidade do modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `class_weight`\n",
    "- **Ajusta o peso das classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `None`: Pesos iguais para todas as classes, apropriado quando todas as classes têm importância equivalente ou quando os dados são relativamente equilibrados. Neste caso, cada exemplo tem o mesmo impacto no treinamento, independentemente de sua classe.\n",
    "- `'balanced'`: Pesos inversamente proporcionais à frequência das classes. Classes menos representadas recebem peso maior, compensando seu menor número de exemplos. Útil quando há desiquilibrio significativo entre aprovados e rejeitados, por exemplo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impacto**: Útil para dados desequilibrados. Ao ajustar os pesos, podemos controlar a importância relativa de falsos positivos versus falsos negativos. Isso é particularmente relevante em decisões de crédito, onde o custo de emprestar a um cliente que não pagará (falso positivo) pode ser muito diferente do custo de negar crédito a um bom pagador (falso negativo).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vantagens do Grid Search com Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testa todas as combinações de parâmetros:** Realiza uma busca exaustiva no espaço de hiperparâmetros, explorando 8400 configurações diferentes para garantir que encontramos a combinação ótima global, não apenas um ótimo local.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usa validação cruzada (ex.: `cv=5`) para garantir resultados robustos:** Divide os dados em 5 conjuntos, treinando e validando cada combinação de parâmetros 5 vezes com diferentes partições. Isso minimiza o risco de otimizar para um subconjunto específico dos dados e fornece uma estimativa mais confiável do desempenho real do modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Permite identificar o modelo ótimo para o problema:** Ao avaliar sistematicamente o desempenho em dados não vistos durante o treinamento, identificamos o conjunto de parâmetros que maximiza a generalização, não apenas o ajuste aos dados de treinamento.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evita overfitting aos dados de validação:** Ao contrário de abordagens manuais de ajuste onde podemos inadvertidamente divulgar informações, a validação cruzada mantém a integridade da avaliação ao nunca usar os mesmos dados para treinamento e validação simultaneamente.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resultados e Visualizações Geradas\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matriz de Confusão:** Mostra classificações corretas/incorretas, permitindo visualizar não apenas a precisão global, mas também os tipos específicos de erros. Especialmente importante em aprovação de empréstimos, onde falsos positivos (aprovações indevidas) e falsos negativos (rejeições indevidas) têm implicações de negócio distintas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importância das Features:** Identifica variáveis mais relevantes, revelando quais fatores têm maior impacto nas decisões do modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top 10 Combinações:** Ranking de modelos testados, mostrando não apenas o melhor conjunto de parâmetros, mas também outras configurações competitivas. Permite avaliar a sensibilidade do desempenho a diferentes escolhas de hiperparâmetros.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Curva de Aprendizagem:** Avalia o desempenho com diferentes tamanhos de treino, indicando se o modelo beneficiaria de mais dados ou se já atingiu um desempenho estável.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualização da Árvore:** Mostra a estrutura de decisão (limitada a profundidade 3 para interpretação), oferecendo transparência sobre as regras aprendidas pelo modelo. Esta visualização pode ser compartilhada com stakeholders não técnicos para aumentar a confiança no modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guardar e Carregar Modelo\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O melhor modelo é guardado em ficheiro:** Preservando os parâmetros ótimos e a estrutura completa da árvore, garantindo reprodutibilidade e consistência nas decisões. Os metadados incluem métricas de desempenho e configurações, facilitando comparações futuras.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Posteriormente pode ser carregado para uso futuro sem novo treino:** Permite implantação eficiente em sistemas de produção sem necessidade de retreinamento. O modelo salvo pode ser integrado a APIs, aplicações web ou outros sistemas de decisão automatizada.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Facilita a implementação em sistemas de produção:** A exportação do modelo em formato joblib permite a sua integração direta em pipelines de produção, mantendo exatamente as mesmas regras de decisão otimizadas durante a fase de desenvolvimento.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Possibilita auditorias retrospectivas:** Manter versões específicas do modelo salvas permite análises retroativas de decisões, necessário para conformidade regulatória em serviços financeiros.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Esta abordagem garante **um modelo de árvore de decisão otimizado e interpretável**, ajustado ao teu problema de classificação com base em dados históricos.\n"

    "- **Accuracy**: 95.08% → O modelo classifica corretamente a grande maioria dos casos. Esta métrica, contudo, deve ser analisada em conjunto com as métricas por classe, uma vez que o dataset poderá ter um desequilíbrio natural entre aprovações e rejeições.\n",
    "- **Precision**: 94.98% → Quando o modelo prevê aprovação, acerta 94.98% das vezes. Esta métrica é particularmente relevante do ponto de vista de risco, pois indica a fiabilidade do modelo ao conceder empréstimos. Um valor elevado significa que poucos empréstimos são indevidamente aprovados.\n",
    "- **Recall**: 95.08% → O modelo consegue identificar corretamente 95.08% das aprovações reais. Esta métrica reflete a capacidade do modelo de não perder oportunidades de negócio válidas. Um recall inferior significaria mais clientes válidos recusados.\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: 94.80% → Boa harmonia entre precisão e recall, confirmando que o modelo não sacrifica uma métrica pela outra. Um F1 Score elevado é essencial em aplicações de crédito, onde tanto falsos positivos como falsos negativos têm custos significativos.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Treino: **0.12s**\n",
    "- Teste: **0.002s**\n",
    "\n",

Esta elevada taxa de identificação de mau crédito potencial representa uma significativa proteção contra perdas financeiras.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Falsos Positivos (123):** Apenas 123 clientes (1% dos casos negativos) receberam aprovação indevida. Estes casos representam o risco potencial de incumprimento, porém o número reduzido obtido sugere que o modelo é bastante conservador na aprovação de créditos duvidosos.\n",

    "- **Falsos Negativos (599):** Cerca de 29% dos clientes que deveriam ser aprovados foram incorretamente rejeitados.

    "**Implicações dos resultados obtidos:** A assimetria observada (melhor desempenho na classe negativa que na positiva) indica uma abordagem conservadora, o que pode ser estrategicamente desejável em períodos de incerteza económica ou para instituições com baixa tolerância ao risco. Para instituições que visam expansão de mercado, ajustar o threshold de classificação ou utilizar class_weight='balanced' pode vir a reduzir os falsos negativos.\n",

    "Esta classe apresenta métricas excecionalmente altas, indicando que o modelo é extremamente **eficaz** a identificar candidatos que não devem receber crédito. Isto é particularmente valioso para instituições financeiras que priorizam a **minimização de risco**.\n",

A curva ROC avalia o desempenho do modelo em diferentes thresholds, e um AUC de 0,92 indica que, na grande maioria dos casos, o modelo atribui uma probabilidade mais alta para amostras positivas verdadeiras do que para negativas.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Learning Curve:\n",
    "- Boa separação entre treino e validação com tendência estável.\n",

    "- Observa-se que mesmo com aproximadamente 15.000 exemplos, o modelo já atinge um desempenho robusto, o que sugere eficiência na utilização dos dados disponíveis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Validation Curve (`max_depth`):\n",
    "- A **profundidade máxima de 10** representa um ponto óptimo de compromisso, onde o modelo captura relações complexas suficientes sem cair em overfitting.\n",
    "- É notável como profundidades acima de 10 mostram o padrão clássico de **overfitting**: melhoria contínua no conjunto de treino, mas deterioração no conjunto de validação.\n",

    "## 12. Conclusion and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our comprehensive analysis of the loan prediction dataset, we can draw several important conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Best Performing Model**: The tuned Random Forest model achieved the highest overall performance with excellent accuracy and F1-score. The model successfully balances precision and recall, making it suitable for loan default prediction where both false positives and false negatives have significant consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Importance**: Through multiple analysis methods (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SHAP values), we found that the most important features for predicting loan defaults were:\n",
    "   - `loan_percent_income`: The ratio of loan amount to income is a strong predictor\n",
    "   - `loan_grade`: The assigned loan grade by the financial institution provides valuable information\n",
    "   - `person_income`: The applicant's income level plays a crucial role\n",
    "   - `loan_int_rate`: The interest rate assigned to the loan is an important indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Selection Considerations**:\n",
    "   - **Random Forest**: Best overall performer with excellent accuracy and F1-score, but with moderate training time\n",
    "   - **Decision Tree**: Simpler model with good interpretability and fast training time, but slightly lower accuracy\n",
    "   - **KNN**: Good accuracy when properly tuned, but slower prediction time with larger datasets\n",
    "   - **SVM**: Strong performance with linear kernel but significantly higher training time with large datasets\n",
    "   - **Neural Network**: Good performance but longer training time and less interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trade-offs**:\n",
    "   - There's a clear trade-off between model complexity/accuracy and training/inference time\n",
    "   - More complex models (Random Forest, Neural Network) generally performed better but required more computational resources\n",
    "   - Simpler models (Decision Tree, KNN) offer reasonable performance with faster training\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Practical Implementation**: For a production environment, the tuned Random Forest model would be recommended due to its superior performance, reasonable training time, and good interpretability through feature importance and SHAP values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Future Work**: To further improve the model, we could:\n",
    "   - Collect more data to better represent edge cases\n",
    "   - Engineer additional features that capture financial behavior patterns\n",
    "   - Explore ensemble methods that combine multiple models\n",
    "   - Address class imbalance through advanced techniques like SMOTE or adaptive sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The loan default prediction model developed in this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning approaches for risk assessment in financial institutions. By accurately identifying potential defaults, institutions can make more informed lending decisions, reduce financial losses, and potentially offer better terms to low-risk applicants.\n"
