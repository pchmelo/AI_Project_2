    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This project's goal is to predict whether an applicant is approved for a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "To acomplish our goal we used the dataset for Loan Approval Prediction from Kaggle. It contains about 32600 entries, each with 12 attributes, but only 8 of those are numeric-valued. The not numeric ones are as follows:\n",
    "- person_age:\n",
    "    - Age of the loan applicant in years. \n",
    "    - If the applicant's age is of one extreme or the other, being too old or too young, his loan will most likely have higher chances of being refused.\n",
    "- person_income:\n",
    "    - Annual income of the applicant in currency units. \n",
    "    - A higher income strongly correlates to a loan being approved, as the applicant with have higher repayment capability and capacity.\n",
    "- person_home_ownership:\n",
    "    - Housing status of applicant, categorized with four different options, those being MORTGAGE, RENT, OWN and OTHER. \n",
    "    - Home ownership can directly correlate to the financial stability of the applicant while also providing potential collateral, thus facilitating a loan's approval.\n",
    "- person_emp_length:\n",
    "    - Number of years the applicant has been employed at their current job. \n",
    "    - As with housing status, their employment length can correspond to the applicant's income and financial stability, as the longer it is the more stable their financial status is more likely to be.\n",
    "- loan_intent:\n",
    "    - The stated purpose for the loan, categorized with six different options, those being VENTURE, EDUCATION, DEBTCONSOLIDATION, HOMEIMPROVEMENT, MEDICAL and PERSONAL. \n",
    "    - Loan purpose affects risk assessment, as for example education or home improvement motives will likely carry out to a higher earning capacity or asset value, while others like venture or personal are riskier and more prone failure in repaying.\n",
    "- loan_grade: \n",
    "    - The credit quality grade assigned to the loan, ranging from A to G, best to worst.\n",
    "    - Loan grade is used as approval likelihood, representing the lender's internal credit risk assessment. The higher the grade, the lower interest rates and higher approval rates one gets, and vice versa.\n",
    "- loan_amnt:\n",
    "    - The requested loan amount.\n",
    "    - Larger loan amounts obviously represent higher absolute risk for lenders. As a norm, the higher the loan amount the lower the approval threshold, requiring stronger compensating factors like higher income and better credit history.\n",
    "- loan_int_rate:\n",
    "    - The annual interest rate charged on the loan.\n",
    "    - Interest rates reflect risk assessment, as higher rates likely indicate higher perceived risk.\n",
    "- loan_status:\n",
    "    - The target variable, 1 being approved and 0 not approved.\n",
    "    - This is the outcome variable the model will predict.\n",
    "- loan_percent_income:\n",
    "    - The percentage of applicant's income represented by the loan payment.\n",
    "    - This is a critical debt-to-income component, as higher percentages represent greater financial strains. Values of 50% and above face significantly higher rejection.\n",
    "- cb_person_default_on_file: \n",
    "    - Credit bureau record of whether the person has defaulted before, 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no.\n",
    "    - If an applicant has previous defaults, it will dramatically reduce approval chances, as they are strong negative indicators of repayment capability.\n",
    "- cb_person_cred_hist_length:\n",
    "    - Length of the person's credit history in years.\n",
    "    - Longer credit histories allow better risk assessment and generally improve approval chances.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### The solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we used a supervised learning model trained on Kaggle’s dataset. The model’s performance was measured using the accuracy metric, which represents the percentage of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions. In other words, it shows how often the model correctly classified whether a loan was paid or not.\n",

    "loan_int_rate: higher interest rates are more commonly associated with approved loans. Lenders may be more inclined to approve loans with higher interest rates as they offer greater returns, potentially offsetting the risk associated with the borrower.\n",

This could indicate that lenders are willing to approve loans that represent a significant portion of the borrower's income, possibly due to confidence in the borrower's repayment capacity or other compensating factors.\n",

    "To quantitatively assess the impact of each feature on loan approval, we employed a Decision Tree Classifier to evaluate feature importance. The results indicated that:\n",

    "High Importance Features: loan_int_rate, loan_percent_income, and person_income emerged as the most influential predictors.\n",

    "#### Some conclusions from the graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 person_age: \n",
    "Older individuals are less likely to have their loan approved, as lenders might consider life expectancy and financial independence when assessing the likelihood of full repayment over the loan term.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 person_income: \n",
    "Applicants with higher incomes are more likely to be approved because they demonstrate a stronger ability to repay the loan without financial strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 person_home_ownership: \n",
    "Owning a home can increase approval chances, as it indicates financial stability and may provide collateral, reducing the lender's risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 person_emp_length: \n",
    "Longer employment history is typically viewed positively, as it suggests job stability and a consistent income source, which are important for loan repayment.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_intent: \n",
    "The purpose of the loan can influence approval, as lenders may consider some intents (like medical or personal expenses) riskier than others (like home improvement or education).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_grade: \n",
    "Loan grade reflects the applicant’s creditworthiness; lower grades are associated with higher risk and therefore a greater likelihood of rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_amnt: \n",
    "Larger loan amounts may reduce the chances of approval, since they represent a greater financial risk for the lender if the borrower defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_int_rate: \n",
    "Higher interest rates may increase the likelihood of loan approval, as lenders are more willing to take on higher-risk borrowers if they are compensated with greater returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 loan_percent_income: \n",
    "Higher loan-to-income ratios are associated with higher approval rates, possibly indicating that lenders are more flexible when the borrower is willing to commit a larger portion of their income to repayment.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 cb_person_default_on_file: \n",
    "Applicants with a history of default are much less likely to be approved, as past defaults are strong indicators of future risk and potential non-payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 cb_person_cred_hist_length: \n",
    "A longer credit history gives lenders more information to evaluate credit behavior, which can increase the chances of approval due to a more established financial track record."

In real-world applications, splitting the dataset in this way is not a problem, because models are typically deployed to make predictions on data the model hasn't seen before — similar to our test set.
